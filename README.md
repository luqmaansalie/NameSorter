# Name Sorter
Build a name sorter. Given a set of names, order that set first by last name, then by any given names the
person may have. A name must have at least 1 given name and may have up to 3 given names.

The program takes in a file with a list of names and sorts the list by surname, then the rest of the names.
It will print the sorted list as well as write the sorted list to a file called "sorted-names-list.txt"
built on jdk17

To execute the code, run:
java -jar NameSorter-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar "unsorted-names-list.txt"
